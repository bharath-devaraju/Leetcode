| Oct 6 | **778. Swim in Rising Water**        | ðŸ”´ Hard    | Graph, Heap (Priority Queue), Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm | Used a min-heap to simulate water rising â€” similar to Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path. Optimized BFS approach with priority queue. |
| Oct 5 | **417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow** | ðŸŸ  Medium  | Graph, BFS/DFS, Matrix Traversal                   | Performed BFS from both oceans outward to find intersecting reachable cells. Focused on reverse flow simulation.            |
| Oct 4 | **11. Container With Most Water**    | ðŸŸ  Medium  | Two Pointers, Greedy                               | Classic two-pointer optimization problem; reduced O(nÂ²) to O(n).                                                            |
| Oct 3 | **407. Trapping Rain Water II**      | ðŸ”´ Hard    | Graph, Heap (Priority Queue), Simulation           | Used a priority queue to expand from boundary cells inward, simulating trapped water levels.                                |
| Oct 3 | **42. Trapping Rain Water**          | ðŸ”´ Hard    | Two Pointers, Stack, Prefix/Suffix Max             | Implemented efficient two-pointer solution instead of precomputing arrays. Space-optimized O(1).                            |
| Oct 2 | **3100. Water Bottles II**           | ðŸŸ  Medium  | Math, Simulation, Greedy                           | Simulated exchanging bottles iteratively. Careful with integer division and carry-over bottles.                             |
| Oct 2 | **1518. Water Bottles**              | ðŸŸ¢ Easy    | Math, Simulation                                   | Basic iterative version of Water Bottles II â€” straightforward counting problem.                                             |
